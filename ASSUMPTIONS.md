# Assumptions

1. Since I am using Windows, the app is not tested on Safari.
2. Font-sizes and colors used over the app may not be accurate.
3. CORS setting must be done on the server side, however I have not made any changes in server.
   Add headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '\*'} or {mode: "no-cors"} if you get CORS error.
4. If the server data is not accessible, and still getting CORS error after changing server and adding header, download MOESIF Origins and CORS changer app. Temporary work-around.
